				<p>Google has changed its ranking algorithm so many times that it's hard to keep up with the latest changes and tricks. This article will cover some of Google's most recent criteria for indexing pages in order to help you optimize your web content for search engines.</p>
				<p>This article was submitted by Gary Mahon from The Heisenberg SEO Company: <a href="https://heisenbergseo.com/">https://heisenbergseo.com/</a> .</p>
				<p>It is still important to know how Google uses keywords as part of their search engine rankings, but today I'd like to focus on another aspect - relevance.</p>
				<p>You may be wondering what "relevance" means when talking about SEO. It basically refers to whether or not your page contains relevant information that people are looking for. If you create an ecommerce website selling shoes, then obviously all those shoe listings need to have pictures and price details associated with them. But if someone searches for something more specific such as "black patent leather pumps", chances are they won't find any articles, images or videos related to black high heeled shoes. On the other hand, if your business sells software programs, there might be no reason why someone searching for "best accounting softwares" would visit your company blog because you've never discussed accounting software even though you do sell accounting products online (or maybe you do). The point here is to make sure you're providing enough useful, quality content that attracts searchers who are actually interested in finding your product. In this case, rather than focusing entirely on optimizing your content for one type of keyword, try adding additional text based upon different types of questions your customers could ask. For example, instead of using just the word "accountant," use phrases such as "what kind of accountant should i hire?" Or perhaps "which accounting packages provides better security features?". Using these longer variations can draw attention from both human readers AND potential customer queries!</p>
				<p>Update Your Content Regularly. Publish Relevant, Authoritative Content. With new discoveries being made everyday by researchers working at Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc., publishing fresh content frequently is vital to keeping visitors coming back time after time. Not only does having updated content show users that you take pride in maintaining your web presence, but also helps boost traffic via increased visibility. Keep in mind that updating often doesn't mean throwing together quickie posts or rehashing old news stories; creating well written informative blogs or informational reports are much more effective ways to update regularly without sacrificing quality. Also consider including links within your updates which allow others to share your insights through social media outlets.</p>
				<p>Metadata. Another key factor used by search engines to determine relevancy is metadata. As we mentioned earlier, if you own a retail store, then you'll want to ensure that each item listed has detailed pricing info. However, if you run an art gallery, then don't forget to include artist bios, exhibition dates, locations and prices. By giving your viewers lots of pertinent data, you increase the likelihood that they'll click on your listing over competitors' offerings.</p>
				<p>Have a link-worthy site. One way to tell if your site meets the standards required for search engine optimization is to look at your homepage. Does it provide easy access to your main menu items? Do navigation bars clearly outline where various parts of the site lead? Is the amount of clutter minimized? Are the graphics clean and legible? Can users easily read and navigate around your entire site? Finally, always remember to give your visitors with clear directions to get to whatever section/page they seek. A good rule of thumb is to break down large sections into smaller chunks whenever possible. Don't let yourself become lost in too much detail, however, since search crawlers cannot see beyond your primary headline anymore. They simply scan headlines, titles and descriptions in order to figure out what your site is about. When you write headlines, think like this...is it catchy enough to grab my attention right away? Will it compel me to check out the rest of your site?</p>
				<p>Use Alt Tags. An oftentimes overlooked component of search engine optimization is the inclusion of ALT attributes. These special HTML tags convey supplemental descriptive information for image files found on your site. Search bots cannot interpret photos, therefore they rely heavily on ALT tags in order to understand what an image depicts. Simply put, by tagging your images correctly, you can improve your overall SEO results. You can learn more about ALTs and how to use them effectively at http://www.altografix.com/.</p>
				<p>In conclusion, while researching this topic was certainly interesting and enlightening, the best tip I learned is to continue educating myself about new developments in search engine algorithms and techniques. After all, knowledge is power!</p>
